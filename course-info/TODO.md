### 2. Introducing Your Instructors ###

You don't have to take Katherine's word for it - you can see some of her impressive coding abilities in action by downloading [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep) from Google Play. It's got 4.5 stars and over 10 million downloads, so you know she's legit.

Reto really has been around since the very early days of Android, writing this [historical getting started guide](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-11-19-n27.html) a week after the first beta Android SDK was released.

### 7. The Code And Videos ###

#### The Directory Structure of Android Studio ####

More in-depth information can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html).

#### The GitHub Codebase ####

If youâ€™re not comfortable with GitHub or Git you can learn more about both [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud775).

### 8. Starter Code ###

Since you haven't learned about [Activities](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html) or [Fragments](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html), it's okay if you're not familiar with some of the concepts discussed.

### 9. Create a New Android Studio Project ###

Find the Android Studio Installation and Setup Guides for Windows and Mac in our [How to Install Android Studio mini-course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud808).

Don't forget you can check out [Android Studio installation instructions on the developer site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and the [Android Studio known issues](http://tools.android.com/knownissues) if you're having trouble translating what's in the video to what's in your IDE.

### 10. Select A Minimum And Target SDK ###

The graph shown in this video is already out of date - check out the [Android Platform Version Distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=platform_distribution&utm_campaign=training) to get the latest distributions.

Learn more about the specific features released in each version of Android by reviewing the [Android version history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history).

### 11. Select a Target SDK ###

In order to provide a great experience for as many users as possible, use the [Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=support_library&utm_campaign=training) to use features from newer platform releases on devices running older versions and review the [Android Platform Version Distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=platform_distribution&utm_campaign=training) to get the latest platform distribution numbers.

### 12. Finish Creating a New Project ###

Here are two links to Google documentation on creating Fragments: one is titled [Creating Fragments](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/creating.html) and the other is just titled [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html).

### 13. Launch Sunshine And Create An AVD ###

The Android Developer site has more details for [Managing Virtual Devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=managing_avd&utm_campaign=training) and using the [Android Debug Monitor](http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html?&utm_content=ddms&utm_campaign=training) to control emulators.

### 14. Android Software Stack And Gradle ###

[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) is a sophisticated build system that lets you use a simple, declarative DSL to configure the build process of your app. For more info, check out Udacity's [Gradle for Android and Java course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud867/lessons/3968239469/concepts/42836685960923)!

You can find out [more about the Android build system here](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system), or by watching Xavier Ducrohet [describe the new Android SDK build system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCJAgPkpmR0) at Google I/O 2013.

If you're a hardcore command-line guru, be sure to read up on the [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=adb&utm_campaign=training) and other [command line tools](http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html?utm_source=udacity&utm_medium=mooc&utm_term=android&utm_content=tools&utm_campaign=training). You can also find out more about the Android Virtual Machines [ART](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/art.html) and [DART](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/) to see how the Android Runtime works under the covers.

You may need to run chmod +x on gradlew before you can run it. See this [link](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html#buildCmd) for more detailed instructions.
